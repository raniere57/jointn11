                        <p>To help you stock up and save more money, we've created a special bundle plan consisting of <strong>3 and 6 month packages</strong> to go alongside the one month starter option.</p>
                        <p>This is because countless studies of our key ingredients – together with the experiences of our customers – show the <strong>longer you take Joint N-11®, the more effective it becomes.</strong></p>
